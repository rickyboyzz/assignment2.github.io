JMeter
Apache JMeter is an open source software that is used in software testing to test the web applications. It is used to measure the performance and strength of the software that how much heavey load on a server or group of servers it can handle. It is also used to load the test functional behavior of the software. It supports many languages like, Java, PHP, ASP.NET. It just works at protocol level, but it is not a browser. 
JMeter is an open source software that developed by Stefano Mazzocchi of the Apache software foundation. In the beginning it was only used to test the performance of Apache JServ but later company redesigned it to enhance the GUI and to add functional-testing capabilities. The website also offer different sponsorship programs where the company will give benefits who like to donate money to this non-profit organization.
Most of the big companies participate in this kind of applications because they use this software to check the performance of their websites that how fast does their websites work or how many users can work on their websites at the same time. We can also say, the performance testers who check the performance of the software are mostly involve in JMeter because they have to check the overall performance of the software.
We have to use a mirror to download the new release of the JMeter. There is also a backup mirror that we can use when all the mirrors donâ€™t work. We also need java 6 or later of we want or download the latest version of the JMeter. 
There are three main code of conduct for the JMeter: KEYS, PGP and OpenPGP. The first one, KEYS link is used to sign the product that links to the signing keys. The second one, PGP link is used to download the OpenPGP compatible signatures from the main site and the third one, MD5 is used to download the checksum from the main site.
JMeter has very simple process system. First of all, we have to define our requirements, then we have to make a plan that when and where we can implement our plan. Then we have to create scripts on JMeter, and also validate our test environment. Then we can simple execute the tests and monitor them. So, we are done with the script and then we can just simply create the report on out test. 
People get involve with JMeter with many different ways. They use all of the internet sites like moodle.org, forums.com etc. where we can get online help from other people. There are also many people who post different article about JMeter to educate people and JMeter also have its own site where we can download it and post some questions answers for more information. People are mostly using forums because then almost everyone can involve in it. There are also people like me who just go to those forum to get some ideas whenever they got stuck using any software.
